/**
 * Drag-to-scroll for `ref`, with a short inertial glide after a flick.
 *
 * Why this exists: on the Pi's touch panel a finger doesn't pan the
 * page at all. The first attempt at fixing it listened for `touchstart`
 * / `touchmove` and did nothing, which is the tell — the app's WebKitGTK
 * webview never dispatches DOM touch events for this panel, so both the
 * browser's own panning and any touch-event handler are dead ends. It
 * reports presses as *pointer* events instead, which is what this
 * listens to: pointer events are the one input model that covers touch,
 * pen and mouse alike, so the gesture works regardless of how the
 * webview classifies the panel.
 *
 * Axis-locked to vertical: a mostly-horizontal drag is left alone so the
 * shelf carousels keep their own horizontal drag-panning. Once a drag
 * passes the threshold the pointer is captured and the click that would
 * otherwise land at lift-off is swallowed, so flicking the list past a
 * track doesn't start playing it.
 *
 * Note: this assumes the platform does NOT also pan natively — true for
 * the Pi, and the reason the feature is needed. On a platform that does,
 * the two would add up and scroll twice as fast.
