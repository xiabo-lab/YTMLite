/**
 * QQ Music (QQ音乐) — the other major Chinese-language lyric source,
 * alongside NetEase and Kugou. See `netease.ts` for why these exist.
 *
 * Search uses the `client_search_cp` endpoint. The newer `musicu.fcg`
 * desktop service was tried first and rejected every query from here:
 * with no `comm` envelope it answers `req_1.code 2001`, and with one it
 * answers `code 0` and an empty song list, for Chinese and ASCII queries
 * alike. `client_search_cp` returns full results for the same terms, so
 * that is what we use.
 *
 * QQ also publishes word-by-word "QRC" lyrics, but that blob is hex
 * encoded and encrypted with a modified DES before zlib inflation.
 * Porting that is a lot of surface for no visible gain here: the player
 * highlights whole lines, so the per-word timings would be discarded by
 * the parser anyway. We take the plain LRC endpoint instead, which is
 * line-synced and needs no decryption.

 * (`http://tauri.localhost`), and `client_search_cp` answers 400 to any
 * request carrying an Origin it doesn't recognise — so QQ failed on
 * every lookup while the identical curl request succeeded. Sending
 * QQ's own origin is accepted; an empty one works too, a literal
 * "null" does not. Overriding it needs the http plugin's
 * `unsafe-headers` feature, which this app already enables.
